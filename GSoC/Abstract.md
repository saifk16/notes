**The project aims to support and extend SPF’s symbolic execution capabilities which are being limited by certain factors, unhandled common Java runtime exceptions arising from symbolic inputs and the need to polish or fix the issues related to Java 11. This project also aims to address certain issues on SPF like additional support for strings and the impact of Java 11 on previously supported model classes in Java 8 (e.g., Math.java, Scanner.java). This project aims to help SPF detect, model and explore execution paths leading to runtime exceptions such as NullPointerException and IndexOutOfBoundsException. This will involve modifying the core component
s like symbolic bytecode handlers and methods summarizers (e.g., SymbolicStringHandler). This work, primarily, will extend the sv-comp branch resulting in a better version of Symbolic PathFinder.**

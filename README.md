## 🛠 How I take notes

- **Markdown** – For writing structured and readable notes, I use markdown.
	- It is a markup language created by [Jake Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- **Obsidian** – Used for organizing and linking notes.
	- They have a graph view which is very impressive.
- For **syncing** my notes, I use iCloud, let me explain it in a more convenient way - 
	- I use arch by the way, so I created a github repo of my notes.
	- Then I installed ish Shell on my ios device, and then I cloned the repo to my local storage, where ish Shell has kept it's files.
	- Then I just simple copy paste my notes folder to obsidian vault, that is on the iCloud as simple as that.
	- On, Windows I downloaded iCloud from microsoft store, hence I got my all devices synced.
	- For android you can have termux installed and follow the same process.
	- For detailed approach please follow this post on my website => [Link](https://my-new-hugo-si.netlify.app/posts/how-i-sync-my-notes/)

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Expand DSA notes with more problem explanations and solutions
- Add more in-depth notes on Go and backend development
- Improve Android development section with hands-on examples
